# The Pointer (*)
there're so many question around what NFT is and what it mean to own NFTs. some say it a proof of ownership, some says it's a receipt, some say it just a pointer. 

## so... here we are - the pointer. (*)
the Pointer is just a pointer that point toward what others NFT point at. and It can also recursively point to what others Pointer point to too.
so the URI is just `tokenURI = &pointer.tokenURI`.


### to mint 
you can just go to this [etherscan](https://etherscan.io/). mint with any address, tokenID. and this will point to the same object as that NFT.

### to update
same [etherscan](https://etherscan.io/). just update any tokenID you own with to point at a new address, tokenID. ez?
