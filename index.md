# The Pointer (*)
There are so many questions about what NFT is and what it means to own NFTs. Some say it's a proof of ownership, some say it's a receipt, and some say it's just a pointer. 

## so... here we are - the Pointer. (*)
the Pointer is just a pointer pointing toward what others NFT point at. And It can also recursively point to what others Pointer point to too.
so the URI is just `tokenURI = &pointer.tokenURI`.


### to mint 
you can go to this [etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0f6f13b775cbb280b934af832f1c9a188c0f8ea3#writeContract). Mint with any address, tokenID. And this will point to the same object as that NFT.

### to update
same [etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0f6f13b775cbb280b934af832f1c9a188c0f8ea3#writeContract). just update any tokenID you own to point at a new address, tokenID. EZ?
