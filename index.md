# The Pointer (*)
there're so many question around what NFT is and what it mean to own NFTs. some say it a proof of ownership, some says it's a receipt, some say it just a pointer. 

so... here we are. the pointer offer. 
the NFT is a pointer that point toward what others NFT point at. and I can also point to what others Pointer point to too.
so the URI is just `&pointer.tokenURI`. 


to mint can can just go to this [etherscan](https://etherscan.io/). mint with any address, tokenID. and this will point to the same object as that NFT.
